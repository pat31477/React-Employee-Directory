## Description:

This client-side application allows a user to quickly search for an employee's contact information, and will dynamically filter out employees as the user inputs keystrokes.  

The employee list was populated by an API GET Request to https://randomuser.me.  This application was created with React and Bootstrap, and was built as a homework assignment from the Rutgers Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
